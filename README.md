# IoT Intrusion Detection System Dataset

Looking at this dataset, it may have potential to correlate variables such as duration of activity and size of file transfers, port usage and protocol. More to come.

This dataset shows typical behavior for malicious activity as compared to benign. This will help us understand adversarial patterns when internet of things (IoT) devices are targeted. 

Successful obfuscation is an unknown, it is possible that some of the benigns are malicious, however, port usage may provide a good indicator of compromise (IOC) for these situations.

I would also like to correlate the IOCs present for redundancy to assess their usefulness in rule-building situations.
